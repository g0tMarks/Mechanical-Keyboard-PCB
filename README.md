# Mechanical-Keyboard-PCB
 This is a tutorial of my first mechanical keyboard PCB where I will be following 3 tutorials to build my own custom PCB:
 
 - [Ruiqi Mao's PCB guide](https://wiki.ai03.com/link/24#bkmrk-from-ruiqi-mao%27s-pcb)
 - [ai03](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design)
 - [Masterzen](https://www.masterzen.fr/2020/05/03/designing-a-keyboard-part-1/)

The most important part of this is whole process is the initial setup stage, where you learn to setup your workspace, organise your directories, correctly install your local libraries and then store everything in a Github repository.

## Creating the Schematic

This is Open the schemait editor by selecting the 'Mechanical-Keyboard-PCB.kicad_sch'

Once in the schematic editor, press 'a' to open up the symbol library and insert the atmega32u4 MCU. I will use this specific MCU primarily because it matches the package/case (TQFP-44) of the -au version I will buy from au.mouser.com that is a hand-solderable, unlike the MU variant which is a QFN package - the pins are below the case making it harder to solder with a standard soldering iron.
